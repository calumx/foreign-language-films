This is the skeleton of an app which I developed to track my film-viewing habits in 2020, specifically, my ratio of films watched in the English language to films watched in other languages.

This app was originally intended for personal use only, and the code is hosted here purely for archival and demonstration purposes. It is unlikely that this repo will be maintained or updated further. However, if you would like to adapt it for your own use, here's how.

Step 1: [Register as a developer and obtain an API key from TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Step 2: Configure your TMDB Watchlist so that it reflects a log of films you have already watched over the given time period (e.g., the last year). I realise this is not the idiomatic way to use TMDB, however...development was already underway before I had realised this!

(Step 2.5: To use the full functionality of the app, you must also set up a separate list of "recommendations" on TMDB, although you may proceed without doing this.)

Step 3: Replace the commented code with functions of your own - it should be clear what to do and how from these comments, as well as how to handle the resultant data.

**This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Use 'npm start' to run**
